# revival_equals_survival: a data project on the overdose crisis

## Introduction
I learned at a Shopify internship process webinar that applicants would need to submit a personal coding project to walk through. So I decided to build something from scratch by the deadline. And I wanted to ensure my project would be different from everyone else's. 

I chose to focus on the opiate overdose crisis because of my interest in social-justice issues. And it's personal, too; I lost my cousin, Vince, my uncle, Kevin and Xephiral, my friend. This is relevant to my application, as well. Shopify empowers merchants and consumers — but you can't become empowered if you're dead. 

The opiate overdose crisis sits at the nexus of two large social forces — rampant overprescribing of addictive medications and a toxic, unregulated street drug supply. No one deserves to die because of that. And now there's a chance for them to get better. 

Naloxone, a treatment that can temporarily reverse an opioid overdose, is available over the counter at pharmacies around Ontario and across Toronto. 

The purpose of this project is two-fold. First, I use data visualization tools and techniques to tell the story of the overdose epidemic. Second, I've built a simple tool based on a geo-spatial dataset that can inform concerned and compassionate people about the locations of the nearest pharmacies where they can access naloxone. Carrying it on their person, anyone can save a life.
